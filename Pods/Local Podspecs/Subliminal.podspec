                     Subliminal is an open-source framework for writing iOS integration tests. 
                      It provides a familiar OCUnit/SenTest-like interface on top of Appleâ€™s UIAutomation framework, with tests written entirely in Objective-C. 
                      Subliminal also provides a powerful mechanism for your tests to manipulate your application directly.
