                     Subliminal provides an OCUnit/SenTest-like interface on top of Appleâ€™s UIAutomation framework,
                     with tests written entirely in Objective-C. 
                     Subliminal also provides a powerful mechanism for your tests to manipulate your application directly.
                     Visit Subliminal's website for [complete API documentation](http://inkling.github.io/Subliminal/Documentation/).
